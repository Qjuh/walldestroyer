This is a rewrite of the original WallDestroyer made by Tellurium for Idle Game Maker.

The rewrite is made for Idle Game Maker v2 while adding no extra content (yet?).

Feel free to test it at http://orteil.dashnet.org/igm/?g=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Qjuh/walldestroyer/refs/heads/main/walldestroyer.txt and report any issues or even contribute fixes as Pull Requests on this repository.

Full credits for the idea and content go to Tellurium, I myself only adapted it to the v2 of IGM.
